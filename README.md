# MotorImag
Experiment in which participants imagined either a right or a left hand movement. Analysis of region-wise power and inter-regional MIM and statistical testing of these metrics in left vs. right condition. 

The implementation is based on the ROIconn plugin for the free and open source [EEGlab toolbox](https://github.com/arnodelorme/roiconnect).
